#Multi Cluster SSO

OpenUnison can provide a central authentication point for all of your clusters, not just a single one.  There are two options:

1. Have all clusters authenticate to a single OpenUnison
2. Have each OpenUnison authenticate directly to an identity provider, but have the central openunison provide portal links
