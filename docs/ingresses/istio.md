# Istio Integration

OpenUnison works with Istio out-of-the-box.  It's been tested with Istio's side cars and can be deployed to use Istio as an `Ingress` controller.  When deploying with Istio, your helm chart will create the appropriate `Gateway`, `VirtualService`, and `Destination` objects depending on your configuration choices.  The `Service` objects will be named appropriately for Kiali to visualize the connections.

## Deployment

First, add a label to the `openunison` namespace so Istio knows to add the envoy side cars:

```
kubectl label namespace openunison istio-injection=enabled
```

In your values.yaml, set:

1. `network.ingress_type: istio` - Tells the helm chart to create the correct objects
2. `network.ingress_certificate: ou-tls-certificate` - The value should be the name of the `Secret` in the namespace where Istio is running (ie `istio-system`) that stores the certificate Istio should use to serve access to OpenUnison
3. `network.istio.selectors` - List of labels that should be used to associate the `Gateway` with an istio controller.  Default is `istio: ingressgateway`
4. `network.force_redirect_to_tls: false` - Stops OpenUnison from redirecting http to https, instead making the envoy sidecar proxy the TLS termination point

Once deployed, make sure you have created an `ou-tls-certificate` `Secret` in the Istio `Namespace`, `istio-system` by default.  If you let OpenUnison generate its own certificate, you can run:

```
kubectl get secret ou-tls-certificate -n openunison -o yaml | sed 's/namespace[:] openunison/namespace: istio-system/g' | kubectl create -f -
```

With an ingress certificate deployed, you can access OpenUnison via the URL you specified in `network.openunison_host` and access your portal!

## Kiali Integration

Add SSO for your Kiali deployment by following the instructions for [Kiali](../../applications/kiali) in the `Applications` section of these docs.

## No Load Balancer?

If you're running in a development environment or just don't have an external load balancer, you can configure Istio's `ingress-gateway` `Pod` to listen directly on 80 and 443 using this command:

```
kubectl patch deployments istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"istio-proxy","ports":[{"containerPort":15021,"protocol":"TCP"},{"containerPort":8080,"hostPort":80,"protocol":"TCP"},{"containerPort":8443,"hostPort":443,"protocol":"TCP"},{"containerPort":31400,"protocol":"TCP"},{"containerPort":15443,"protocol":"TCP"},{"containerPort":15090,"name":"http-envoy-prom","protocol":"TCP"}]}]}}}}'
```

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### Impersonation and `kubectl exec`

If using OpenUnison in impersonation mode, such as with a cloud hosted cluster, Istio can't be the TLS termination point because Envoy doesn't support the SPDY protocol used by `kubectl exec`, `port-forward`, and `cp`.  The helm chart will automatically setup passthrough TLS to support these functions.  This means that you won't get most of the telemetry on these functions to the oidc-proxy that deploys with OpenUnison.  The `kubectl` commands generated by the portal will automatically embed the correct certificate.

### Connection Refused or Reset

If your browser tells you that the connection is refused, it's one of:

1. Your load balancer isn't setup properly
2. If no load balancer, you haven't setup the host ports correctly
3. If the host ports are all configured properly and the load balancer is setup, did you create the `ou-tls-certificate` `Secret` in the `istio-system` `Namespace`?
