# Getting Help

If you're having issues or just have a question, there are two ways to get help for your deployment:

* Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/openunison/openunison-k8s/issues)
* Obtain a [commercial support contract](https://www.tremolosecurity.com/pricing) from Tremolo Security 

We're happy to help our open source customers get their issues resolved and make sure things are running smoothly.  We also encourage you to request features too!  OpenUnison is always improving.  

Finally, if you're interested in seeing how OpenUnison fits in a larger cluster management ecosystem, our CTO is the co-author of [Kubernetes and Docker: An Enterprise Guide](https://www.tremolosecurity.com/resources/books).  This book will walk your through standing up a cluster using KinD, building out authentication with OpenUnison, RBAC, OPA GateKeeper, Istio, and finally building a platform on Kubernetes with ArgoCD, TektonCD, GitLab, and OpenUnison!
